    <h2>CS-5115 User Interface Design</h2>
    <p>This class focused on the process of designing a user interface 
    for a program. We came up with a concept, asked users about features 
    they would want, analyzed the data, created the application, and 
    then tested the program with actual users. This course had us work 
    in a group of 5 members and we created a working program at the end. 
    I currently have the program install on my smartphone.</p>
