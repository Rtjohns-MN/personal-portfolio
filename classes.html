    <h1>Class Details</h1>
    <p>This page contains a summary of most of the courses I have taken 
    at the University of Minnesota.</p>

    <h2>CS-5115 User Interface Design</h2>
    <p>Projects: Tabletop Manager<br>
    Keywords: Android Studio, Java, xml, User testing, group, Github</p>
    <p>This class focused on the process of designing a user interface 
    for a program. We came up with a concept, asked users about features 
    they would want, analyzed the data, created the application, and 
    then tested the program with actual users. This course had us work 
    in a group of 5 members and we created a working program at the end. 
    I currently have the program installed on my smartphone.</p>

    <h2>CS-4131 Internet Programming</h2>
    <p>Projects: XKCD password generator, API mashup, Word Search<br>
    Keywords: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Python, Flask, SQL, Webpage, database, partner, Github</p>
    <p>This class had us create websites using HTML, javascript, and the 
    flask web framework. This course involved creating a number of applications,
    using a number of different languages and features. The majority of them have 
    been connected to this site and are available as example programs.</p>

    <h2>CS-4511 Introduction to Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Projects: Eternal Jukebox analysis<br>
    Keywords: Python, Javascript, HTML, AI, First Order Logic, Propositional Logic, 
    Constraint Satisfaction Problems, Search Problems, partner</p>
    <p>We learned the elements of AI in computer systems with search 
    algorithms, decision trees, and First Order Logic. At the end of the course
    we chose a relevant project, our being examining the functionality of 
    the Eternal Jukebox Program.</p>

    <h2>CS-5801 Software Engineering I</h2>
    <p>Projects: TAPS User Requirements, TAPS System Specifications<br>
    Keywords: Documentation, Requirements, Specifications, UML Diagram, group, OO programming</p>
    <p>In this class we learned about part of the procedure that companies go through when
    developing software, particularly the planning stages. During the course the entire class
    was given the task of creating the User Requirements and Design documents for a 
    program called TAPS. In addition we talked about the Waterfall and Agile design methodologies,
    defining the good and bad parts of both. Risk assessment was examined and then different
    types of testing was discussed.</p>

    <h2>CS-4061 Introduction to Operating Systems</h2>
    <p>Projects: Chat Client, Linux Shell Commando<br>
    Keywords: Linux, C Language, shell, processes, asynchronous processes, Makefile, partner, Valgrind</p>
    <p>This class looked at the lower levels of programming and how to interact with the 
    operating system of a computer. The programs were written in the C langauge and 
    made use of many Linux commands to function. The first project of the course
    was a shell program which can be run over the command line, allowing the user
    to run other processes, but also get feedback and information not normally 
    tracked by the command line. The second program made use of remote connections 
    as a chat server along with client programs which could connect to said server.</p>

    <h2>CS-3081 Program Design and Development</h2>
    <p>Projects: Flashphoto Imaging Application<br>
    Keywords: C++, Libraries, Makefile, Github, OO programming, Valgrind, UML Diagram</p>
    <p>This course went over the process of coding and building a program. We 
    were tasked with coding the filters for the paint program. Using design 
    patterns discussed in class we planned out how the filters connected together 
    and how best to add them into the program. Using a UML diagram we mapped the 
    program and the connections between the objects. After creating the filters 
    we were asked to add command line function to the program and create tests 
    which ensured that the program functioned correctly.</p>

    <h2>CS-4611 Programming in Graphics and Games</h2>
    <p>Projects: Processing, Car Soccer, Earthquake, Shading, Dance<br>
    Keywords: Processing, C++, Visual Studio, openGL, Github</p>
    <p>This class had us work on animated and sometimes interactive 
    visual projects in 2D and 3d. The Text Rain project uses a camera to 
    get video, and then add falling letters which get stopped when they hit
    dark objects. Earthquake displays a globe which shows the locations of
    all earthquakes around the world about when they happened chronologically.
    The map can be displayed in either flat or spherical modes.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>CS-5801 Spatial Computing</h2>
    <p>Projects: <br>
    Keywords: SQL, GPS, databases, partner</p>
    <p>Spatial Computing discussed the usage of SQL to examine 
    geographic information and relational databases. We also looked at 
    how GPS and satellite data is used to get information about the world.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>CS-2021 Machine Architecture and Organization</h2>
    <p>Projects: <br>
    Keywords: C Language, Machine Code, Valgrind</p>
    <p>This course went through the lower levels of programming, 
    particular the machine architecture and efficiency topics.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>CS-2041 Advanced Programming Principles</h2>
    <p>Projects: <br>
    Keywords: Ocaml, Functional Programming, Search Problems</p>
    <p>Ocaml was used in this class to demonstrate the functional programming
    approach of coding to solve problems.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>CS-4041 Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
    <p>Projects: <br>
    Keywords: Divide and Conquer, Recursive, Linear Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Binary Tree, Dynamic Programming</p>
    <p>This course examined the different types of algorithms used to solve many 
    complex problems. It made major note of the Divide and Conquer algorithms used for
    search programs.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>CS-4011 Formal Language and Automata</h2>
    <p>Projects: <br>
    Keywords: </p>
    <p>This class examined the base theoretical level of programs as simple 
    automata systems. It showed how a program can be mapped as a series of 
    steps with conditional paths to follow.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>CS-2033 Linear Algebra</h2>
    <p>Projects: <br>
