    <p>My name is Robert Johnson, and I've built this entire website 
    from scratch. It's still pretty rough honestly, but its a been a 
    good experience making this site. I plan to add some javascript 
    to create some cool looking graphics here, and a few simpler utility 
    style functions too. I might somehow link it to some 
    other sites and projects I plan to work on in the future.</p>
    
    <p>I'm currently looking to get hired for some type of software 
    development position. I enjoy coding and designing software, so I 
    will likely be content working on most anything of that sort. If you're 
    looking to hire someone with my skills I'm on LinkedIn:</p>

    to use to contact me.</p>

    <p>I've graduated from the University of Minnesota in December 2019 
    with a bachelors in Computer Science. It was a good experience and I 
    can say that I've learned a ton from the school, which should be 
    easily apparent considering this website is based on that knowledge.</p>

    <h1 class="bannered">Personal Information</h1>
    <p>I've lived my entire life in Minnesota and considering my fiance 
    I plan to remain a permanent resident for the forseeable future. 
    That doesn't mean I don't intend to travel, but Minnesota will 
    always be that place I feel as home.</p>
    <p>To relax I enjoy playing video games and reading books. I've read 
    most of the discworld series by Terry Pratchett and my favorite book 
    is "Reaper Man". For video games I play a number of different types: 
    shooters, 4X, RPGs. I enjoy most games with big, stompy robots, and games 
    with a lot of customization, like the Mechwarrior games. In multiplayer 
    games I enjoy cooperative play the most. My username in most places 
    is TGWabba if you want to search for me on Steam or whatever.</p>
    <p>Other hobbies I have is Gamemastering for Pathfinder, writing stories, and game design. 
    I'm currently running a Pathfinder group for a custom version of the 
    World's Largest Dungeon I call the Waldis campaign. It's a mega-dungeon 
    style campaign which I have had going since March 2017. I come up 
    with a lot of interesting concepts while I'm alone and many of them 
    I feel would make good stories. I write when I have the free time to 
    do so. With game design, some of those story ideas would also make 
    interesting games. Some are out of my league to build but a few are 
    just on the edge and I have dabbled with making them. The one I want 
    to finish the most is the Fragmented Series. The flash version 
    prototype of the game had bad memory leaks and didn't quite have the 
    quality which I though it should have. If you'd like to see that 
    version I posted it onto deviantArt back when I was trying to work 
    on it.</p>
