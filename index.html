    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>This website is a space to present all of the work I've done in 
    various classes for school and personal works. Each subpage contains 
    more detail about each individual project and links to any elements 
    which are presentable. The websites I created for school have the 
    site links to each of their respective pages.</p>
    <div class="spacer"></div>
    
    <h2>Class Details</h2>
    <p>A number of classes I've taken have relevance to different fields
    and I explain the rough content which was discussed in each of the classes. 
    Many of them have related school projects and those are discussed briefly 
    on the class page and more in depth on the School Projects page.</p>
    
    <h2>School Projects</h2>
    <p>Each of the school projects were created during the course of the 
    classes I've taken. The details for each specific project is explained 
    in full detail and links lead to the actual projects themselves.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Works</h2>
    <p>My personal works are the various projects I have created on my 
    own time. The projects themselves were created out of personl interest 
    in the topic or due to my desire to create something using the skills 
    which I have learned over the years.</p>

    <h1 id="index_topic_1">Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <p>Object Oriented Programming is a style of programming which makes 
    use of objects which contain data. These objects can encompass a 
    huge variety of types: accounts, geographic data, shape representations.
    Objects are generally defined by a structure called a class. A 
    class contains the attritubes and methods which an object uses to 
    store and manipulate its data. An object itself is a member of the 
    class, but the object itself is just one member of many objects which 
    are that class.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
    
    <table><tr><th>
        <ul class="pillars">
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Data Abstraction</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        </th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The four major principles of OOP are used to created more 
    orgranized, functional and understandable programs. </p>
    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is when we restrict access to the variables within 
    a class by making them private. Instead we use public methods which 
    return or change the values of that class. As this prevents direct 
    access to the data we can add more control over how the data is 
    retrieved/changed during runtime.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction is when we build classes in a way which allows 
    one class to make use of the functionality of a second class without 
    needing that first class to have any detailed information about how 
    that second class works internally.</p>
    
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance is when we use parent classes with more specific 
    subclasses so that each sub-class has the parents components, but 
    can also have its own components specific to itself. This allows us 
    to build the parent methods only once, and reuse them for each 
    sub-class. The relationship between these 2 classes is a "is-a" 
    relationship. If a class contains another class then it's a "has-a" 
    relationship.</p>
    
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism allows us to use inherited classes to treat them as 
    the same type of class, regardless of how they have been modified. 
    EXAMPLE: Any food can be eaten, but some are eaten using hands or 
    utensils. Utensils are more common so we set that as the default 
    means. If the food is eaten using hands then the method which is 
    used to eat the food is overriden and changed to eat using hands.</p>

    <h1 id="index_topic_2">Solving Technical Problems</h1>
    <p>In software technical problems occur sometimes as design choices 
    can lead to unforseen errors. To resolve these errors we should follow 
    a procedure.</p>
    <h2>Gather Information</h2>
    <p>The first step is to gather all of the information we have about 
    the problem. If the issue was reported by someone else ask that person 
    all the relevant questions about the problem. Good questions to ask are 
    <br>What were you doing just before the problem occured?
    <br>Do any error messages come up when the error happens and what do they say?
    <br>How often does this problem occur?
    <br>Does anyone else who uses the software have this problem?
    <br>Is there a set of steps to trigger the problem?</p>
    <h2>Find the Problem Trigger</h2>
    <p>Test the system to find a way to trigger the error on your version 
    of the system. This confirms that the problem exists within the system 
    itself and may give a hint as to where the problem resides. If the 
    client gave information about the problem use that to help trigger 
    the error. It would help to use some type of process tracking program 
    to give some additional information when the error occurs.</p>
    <h2>Isolate the Problem</h2>
    <p>The third step is figuring out where the problem is in the system. 
    Use any information from the previous steps to help determine what area 
    the problem is in. Once you think you have found the general area/cause 
    isolate that section of the system and try to trigger the error. If the 
    error occurs as before, then we have located the general area of the error 
    and can further isolate the system to find the exact cause of the error. If 
    the error does NOT occur when isolated that means that a larger section 
    of the system contains the error. While more difficult to resolve, we can 
    still examine the steps the program is taking which causes the error.<br>
    During this process it may help to use some types of data reporting to 
    gain additional information during the error. The actual data to track 
    depends on the type of error.</p>
    <h2>Plan a Solution</h2>
    <p>Once you've found the location of the problem you need to determine 
    a solution for it. Some errors are quick to resolve, and may just need 
    a couple lines of code to fix, while more complex ones require a larger 
    reaching solution. Planning a solution helps avoid creating additional 
    problems while fixing this one. Errors can potentially cascade into a larger spiral 
    of problems, which can undermine the system as a whole. Make sure to document 
    the changes made for the solution so that in case the fix causes more problems 
    you can revert to the previous state and try a different solution.</p>
    <h2>Implement and Test Solution</h2>
    <p>Follow the planned steps to fix the error and then run the relevant 
    tests on the system to ensure that the error is fixed and then that 
    it did not cause any additional errors. While it may seem redundant to 
    test the entirety of the system, catching errors before they are sent 
    out to clients is a huge priority.</p>
    <h2>Deploy the Solution to Clients</h2>
    <p>The updates need to be sent to the clients so that the error no 
    longer occurs for them as well. You should ensure that the client 
    which reported the error has the problem fixed as well.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h1 id="index_topic_3">UML Diagrams</h1>
    <p>UML diagrams can be used for a number of different things but the
    experience I've had was using them to represent class diagrams for 
    programs.</p>
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects are represented by boxes with text. The object box is generally 
    split into three separate boxes: title, attributes, and actions. <br>
    The title displays the object name and can have the type as well. An object name
    in italics is a abstract class, which itself will have no defined objects, but
    have representative sub classes which do have defined instances.<br>
    The attributes list the parameters and objects used by the class. 
    Often they have the associated type for each parameter listed as well 
    as its name, and value. A + by the name indicates that the attribute 
    is public, while a - represents a private attribute.<br>
    Actions are the methods and functions which the class can perform. 
    It should list the name, parameters, and possibly the output of the 
    function.</p>
    <h2>Relationship Arrows</h2>
    <p>Relationships between classes are defined using different types of arrows.
    A solid arrow indicates that the class uses the target class. An arrow with 
    dashes or a hollow head means that the class is a subclass of the parent class. 
    A line with a diamon head is an aggregate of the class, meaning that it 
    contains many of that object in that class.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h1 id="index_topic_4">Code Testing</h1>
    <p>Code testing is done to ensure that the program passes all of the
    required tasks, even as changes are made to the system.</p>
    <hr>
    
    <h1 id="index_topic_5">RESTful APIs</h1>
    <p>REST is an acronym for REpresentational State Transfer and is an
    architectual style for distributed hypermedia systems. There are 6 
    guiding constraints for using the REST style which are as follows.</p>
    <p>1 Client-server: separating the user interface elements and the data 
    management elements the entire system becomes more portable. Effectively,
    different user interfaces can send messages to perform the same tasks
    as they are referencing the same calls inside of the data management section.</p>
    <p>2 Stateless: Session state is kept entirely by the client. This means that 
    any request sent by the client contains all of the relevant information 
    which the data manager needs to perform the action requested.</p>
    <p>3 Cacheable: All data is labeled either cacheable or non-cacheable. 
    Effectively asking if the data should be saved to be reused or if it 
    is single use and not to be saved.</p>
    <p>4 Uniform Interface: Using the software engineering principle of 
    generality to the component interface, the system is simpified and improved.
    Simply put, the interface should be consistent, and retain common elements.
    This reduces the need to teach new functions, and quickens familiarity with the
    system as a whole.<br>
    Four Major Constriants for the Interface: identification of resources; 
    manipulation of resources through representations; self-descriptive messages;
    hypermedia as the engine of application state.</p>
    <p>5 Layered System: Restrain component behavior to the each individual 
    layer to reduce redundancy and errors.</p>
    <p>6 Code on Demand (optional): allow extendability in the form of 
    applets or scripts. This adds modularity under the control of the user 
    so the core system can have a reduced number of provided features.</p>
    <h2>Managing Resources</h2>
    <p>Resources represent information which can be name inside of the system: 
    a document, an image, a collection of other resources, a person, and so on. 
    Every resource has some type of identifier to allow interaction between the 
    components of the system. Each resource needs a type to help the user or 
    system understand what the resouce is and how to use it.</p>
    <p>When managing resources the system will use the HTTP methods of 
    GET/PUT/POST/DELETE. While these methods have their own circumstances 
    they are not a lone handler to the task. Resource information needs to
    be tested and interpretted. Any query for resources should be a list of 
    links to that resource with addition information about it, not simply a 
    list of the resources. This is because each individual resource does not properly
    represent the information on its own.</p>
