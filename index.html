    <h1 class="bannered">Introduction</h1>
    <p>This website is a space to present all of the work I've done in 
    various classes for school and personal works. Each subpage contains 
    more detail about each individual project and links to any elements 
    which are presentable. The websites I created for school have the 
    site links to each of their respective pages.</p>
    
    <h2>Class Details</h2>
    <p>A number of classes I've taken have relevance to different fields
    and I explain the rough content which was discussed in each of the classes. 
    Many of them have related school projects and those are discussed briefly 
    on the class page and more in depth on the School Projects page.</p>
    
    <h2>School Projects</h2>
    <p>Each of the school projects were created during the course of the 
    classes I've taken. The details for each specific project is explained 
    in full detail and links lead to the actual projects themselves.</p>
    
    <h2>Personal Works</h2>
    <p>My personal works are the various projects I have created on my 
    own time. The projects themselves were created out of personl interest 
    in the topic or due to my desire to create something using the skills 
    which I have learned over the years.</p>

    <h1 class="bannered">Object Oriented Programming</h1>
    <p>Object Oriented Programming is a style of programming which makes 
    use of objects which contain data. These objects can encompass a 
    huge variety of types: accounts, geographic data, shape representations.
    Objects are generally defined by a structure called a class. A 
    class contains the attritubes and methods which an object uses to 
    store and manipulate its data. An object itself is a member of the 
    class, but the object itself is just one member of many objects which 
    are that class.</p>

    <h2>Four Pillars of OOP</h2>
    
    <table><tr><th>
        <ul class="pillars">
            <li>Encapsulation</li>
            <li>Data Abstraction</li>
            <li>Inheritance</li>
            <li>Polymorphism</li>
        </ul>
        </th>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>The four major principles of OOP are used to created more 
    orgranized, functional and understandable programs. </p>
    <h2>Encapsulation</h2>
    <p>Encapsulation is when we restrict access to the variables within 
    a class by making them private. Instead we use public methods which 
    return or change the values of that class. As this prevents direct 
    access to the data we can add more control over how the data is 
    retrieved/changed during runtime.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
    <p>Abstraction is when we build classes in a way which allows 
    one class to make use of the functionality of a second class without 
    needing that first class to have any detailed information about how 
    that second class works internally.</p>
    
    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <p>Inheritance is when we use parent classes with more specific 
    subclasses so that each sub-class has the parents components, but 
    can also have its own components specific to itself. This allows us 
    to build the parent methods only once, and reuse them for each 
    sub-class. The relationship between these 2 classes is a "is-a" 
    relationship. If a class contains another class then it's a "has-a" 
    relationship.</p>
    
    <h2>Polymorphism</h2>
    <p>Polymorphism allows us to use inherited classes to treat them as 
    the same type of class, regardless of how they have been modified. 
    EXAMPLE: Any food can be eaten, but some are eaten using hands or 
    utensils. Utensils are more common so we set that as the default 
    means. If the food is eaten using hands then the method which is 
    used to eat the food is overriden and changed to eat using hands.</p>
