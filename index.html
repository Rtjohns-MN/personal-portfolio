    <h1>Home</h1>
    <p>This website is a space to present all of the work I've done in 
    various classes for school and personal works. Each subpage contains 
    more detail about each individual project and links to any elements 
    which are presentable. The websites I created for school have the 
    site links to each of their respective pages.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="bannered">Class Details</h2>
    <p>A number of classes I've taken have relevance to different fields
    and I explain the rough content which was discussed in each of the classes. 
    Many of them have related school projects and those are discussed briefly 
    on the class page and more in depth on the School Projects page.</p>
    <div class="botbanner"><br></div>
    
    <h2 class="bannered">School Projects</h2>
    <p>Each of the school projects were created during the course of the 
    classes I've taken. The details for each specific project is explained 
    in full detail and links lead to the actual projects themselves.</p>
    <div class="botbanner"><br></div>
    
    <h2 class="bannered">Personal Works</h2>
    <p>My personal works are the various projects I have created on my 
    own time. The projects themselves were created out of personl interest 
    in the topic or due to my desire to create something using the skills 
    which I have learned over the years.</p>
