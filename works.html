    <h1>Personal Works</h1>
    <p>This page details the personal works that I have been doing over time. 
    A few of these were done before I attended the University of Minnesota 
    while some happened during, and others are on going projects. 
    There's a bunch so here is a table of contents (soonish.)</p>

    <h1>Waldis Pathfinder Campaign</h1>
    <p>The Waldis Pathfinder campaign is an ongoing project which involves 
    creating an entire series of challenges for my group of players. Before 
    you simply skip this as not relevant, consider how much management and 
    organization it takes to manage a campaign spanning not months, but years. 
    I've been designing everything from the very start, building battles, 
    creating social interactions, balancing loot and difficulty.
    I've had to adjust entire sections as the players choose options I didn't 
    consider, making entirely new story trees as a result. Not only is there 
    a lot of different things to organize behind the scenes but then I 
    actively perform them infront of my player group. During the performance 
    I need to follow what I set and then adjust to react to what the players 
    have decided to do. All of this needs to be done following the rules 
    of the game, while making it fun for everyone involved.</p>

    <h1>Flash Programs</h1>
    <p>I've created quite a few Flash programs as the Flash application 
    easily lets you combine code and artwork in a single program.</p>
