    <h1>School Projects</h1>
    <p>This page details all of the projects I've worked on in the classes 
    I've taken at the University of Minnesota. There a good number of them 
    so I will create a table of contents (at some point).</p>

    <h2 id="taps">TAPS Documentation</h2>
    <h3>Files</h3>

    <p>The Teaching Assistant Processing System (TAPS) documentation was 
    created in the CS5801 Software Engineering 1 course. During the course 
    I was assigned to a group and we were tasked to create the documentation 
    to encompass the TAPS user requirements and the design specifications. 
    We did not create the actual program, just the documentation. 
    The User Requirements document describes the information given from the 
    user converted into the Functional Requirements. It also details the 
    cases for using the program maps them onto interaction diagrams. The 
    Design Document explains the Business Layer Module (BLM) part of the program 
    which connects the user interface and the database of the system. The 
    document details all of the functions which the BLM uses to communicate 
    with the UI, database and internally when processing information.</p>
    <p>The TAPS program is designed to simplify the process and organization 
    of managing the teaching assistants applying for positions at the University of 
    Minnesota. The system consists of students who are applying to be TAs, professors who 
    need TAs and the management who are assigning students for the positions. 
    This defines the three main types of users: Applicants, Faculty and Administrators. 
    Each of these three users need to be able to perform their own major tasks. 
    The applicants must be able to create and manage their applications. The 
    Faculty must be able to post positions which they need TAs for. The 
    Administrators must be able to look at open TA positions from the faculty 
    and then search for appropriate applicants who can fill those positions.</p>

    <h2 id="tabletop">Tabletop Manager</h2>

    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CdlfW0Ej_FlP8R5swoi3IwkxolAIY82/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">App Presentation</a>
    <p>The Tabletop Manager program was created in the CS5115 User Interface Design. 
    We were assigned a group and allowed to choose the application to build for the class.
    The group settled on creating an application which assisted with 
    managing the character sheet for the Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition game. 
    The app was built in Android Studio over roughly 3 weeks.</p>

    <h2>Commando Shell Program</h2>
    <p>Commando is a shell program created in the Linux operating system 
    using the C language. 
    It extends the terminal allowing users to run other programs, tracks their status and 
    can read their outputs when they are completed.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Server Chat Program</h2>
    <p>This server chat program only runs on the servers at the University 
    of Minnesota. It connects one or more client programs into a chat server 
    to allow communication between all of the clients.</p>

    <h2>XKCD Password generator</h2>
    <p>This web application creates a randomly generated set of words to 
    create a password which is easy to remember but long enough to be 
    difficult to guess.</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>API Mashup</h2>
    <p>This web application works as a search engine which uses the input 
    to search both youtube and flickr websites and returns the relevant 
    results. (NOTE: the number of videos searched per day is limited)</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>Word Search</h2>
    <p>This web application is used to find words or certain sizes with 
    certain pattern sets. Its hosted on Heroku.</p>

    <h2>Eternal Jukebox Analysis</h2>
    <p>The Eternal Jukebox was created by Paul Lamere. The site allows 
    users to search for a song using the Spotify web API, which also separates 
    the song into segments and compares the similarity of each segment. Eternal Jukebox 
    then reassembles the segments back into the song, but with connections 
    between each matching segment. While playing the song when it hits a segment 
    with a connecting segment there is a chance that it will follow the connection 
    and continue at the new location. This allows the song to effectively remix 
    itself dynamically to create an infinite length track.</p>
    <p>We analyzed the program to find the best single loop location in all 
    songs. Eternal Jukebox compares the various parts of the track to find 
    the compatable loop sections. We adjusted the threshold for the loops to 
    only allow loops at the end and beginning and then only high quality ones.</p>

    <h2>Flashphoto Imaging Application</h2>
    <p>This program is a Photoshop style art program. My task was to create 
    the filters for the program and then to give the program a terminal 
    control to automate some of the features.</p>
