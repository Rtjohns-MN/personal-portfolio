    <h2 id="taps">TAPS Documentation</h2>
    <h3>Files</h3>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WbvEg-HbVLfsNQ--LHSocdM8xCvOkaEz/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">User Requirements</a>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c0DpfirSwp6-qAUAjhYIDdOmX7YqUoJt/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Design Document</a>
    <p>The Teaching Assistant Processing System (TAPS) documentation was 
    created in the CS5801 Software Engineering 1 course. During the course 
    I was assigned to a group and we were tasked to create the documentation 
    to encompass the TAPS user requirements and the design specifications. 
    We did not create the actual program, just the documentation. 
    The User Requirements document describes the information given from the 
    user converted into the Functional Requirements. It also details the 
    cases for using the program maps them onto interaction diagrams. The 
    Design Document explains the Business Layer Module (BLM) part of the program 
    which connects the user interface and the database of the system. The 
    document details all of the functions which the BLM uses to communicate 
    with the UI, database and internally when processing information.</p>
    <p>The TAPS program is designed to simplify the process and organization 
    of managing the teaching assistants applying for positions at the University of 
    Minnesota. The system consists of students who are applying to be TAs, professors who 
    need TAs and the management who are assigning students for the positions. 
    This defines the three main types of users: Applicants, Faculty and Administrators. 
    Each of these three users need to be able to perform their own major tasks. 
    The applicants must be able to create and manage their applications. The 
    Faculty must be able to post positions which they need TAs for. The 
    Administrators must be able to look at open TA positions from the faculty 
    and then search for appropriate applicants who can fill those positions.</p>
    <p>My specific task on the team was as project manager and I authored a 
    number of sections in the two documents. In the Requirements Specifications 
    I wrote sections 1.5 System Purpose and 2 Functional Requirements. 
    I also created the TAPS User Diagram in section 5.2.
    In the Design Document I created the Class diagram 4.1 and wrote all 
    of the class descriptions in section 4.2.<br>
    As team manager I was able to lead the others to assist them as they 
    created the Interaction Diagrams, Use Case Models, and Sequence Diagrams.</p>

    <h2 id="tabletop">Tabletop Manager</h2>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cCBjSF4tHyLpXzaqwdRQrwEmJ87QE2sm/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">App Poster</a>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13CdlfW0Ej_FlP8R5swoi3IwkxolAIY82/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">App Presentation</a>
    <p>The Tabletop Manager program was created in the CS5115 User Interface Design. 
    We were assigned a group and allowed to choose the application to build for the class.
    The group settled on creating an application which assisted with 
    managing the character sheet for the Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition game. 
    Before doing any coding we asked potential users what kind of features 
    that they would want the application to be able to do. Using this 
    information we decided on what features to focus on during the short 
    period we had to build the actual application.
    The app was built in Android Studio over roughly 3 weeks.</p>
    <p>I worked on the actions menu of the program. I designed and built 
    the ActionsLayoutClass, ActionCardView and the ActionEditView. These 
    three classes are used to contain and use the data related to the 
    attack actions for combat in D&D 5e. One major problem I had to deal 
    with in the actions was the summing of the values. When a user changes 
    a value the sum value needs to update, but when a user deletes a value 
    it becomes an empty string, but should instead be a 0. In order to fix this problem 
    I used a try-catch setup, which catches the error which happens when the empty
    string is sent to the function determining the value. 
    It then instead sends a 0, which is the appropriate response.</p>

    <h2 id="price_compare">Cereal Price Comparison Report</h2>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWmgyHHvGH2mua-k5m_jRrCfVKfgsaeO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Cereals Report</a>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sWmgyHHvGH2mua-k5m_jRrCfVKfgsaeO/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Cereals Data</a>
    <p>This report examines the difference of prices between the cereals 
    sold at Cub Foods and Aldi. As each cereal has different weights and 
    prices, the actual values used for comparison is the dollars per ounce. 
    The data is compared using a paired test 
    as each cereal from one store has a counterpart at the other. Using 
    bar graphs and boxplots its clear to see that there is a trend which 
    favors one store over the other. As the dollars per ounce is the main 
    focus the final comparison is represented using a Q-Q plot and a 
    histogram of the dollar per ounce difference. To ensure that this 
    value was not created by random chance, it was processed using the 
    program R's t.test to find the probability that it was random.</p>

    <h2 id="commando_shell">Commando Shell Program</h2>
    <p>Commando is a shell program created in the Linux operating system 
    using the C language. 
    It extends the terminal allowing users to run other programs, tracks their status and 
    can read their outputs when they are completed.</p>

    <h2 id="chat_server">Server Chat Program</h2>
    <p>This server chat program only runs on the servers at the University 
    of Minnesota. It connects one or more client programs into a chat server 
    to allow communication between all of the clients.</p>

    <h2 id="word_search">Word Search</h2>
    <a href="https://mysterious-oasis-86042.herokuapp.com/index" target="_blank">Word Search Program</a>
    <p>This application is hosted on Heroku (it will take a while to start up).<br>
    This web application is used to find words of certain sizes or with 
    certain pattern sets. You can enter letters to build words with and then choose 
    how long the word can be. You can also enter a pattern with . as a 
    blank space for each letter.</p>
    <p>The program works by taking the inputs and comparing the parts to a 
    large database of words. It filters out words which contain unused letters, 
    or patterns, then restricts them by length. </p>
    <p>Both pages are created using flask forms to check the for valid inputs 
    and create a dynamic page. The searching and filtering is done using python. 
    <br>NOTE: The definitions never match up to the words so they are disabled.</p>

    <h2 id="microblog">Microblog Site</h2>
    <a href="https://rtj-flask-microblog.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Microblog Site</a>
    <p>This web application allows users to sign in and post blog information. 
    It uses flask and SQL on the back end to manage datastore accesses and then 
    python to manage the primary user requests.<br>
    You are welcome to test out the site by creating your own account.
    Its hosted on Heroku (it will take a while to start up).</p>

    <h2 id="password_gen">XKCD Password generator</h2>
    <p>This web application chooses a set of randomly generated words to 
    create a password which is easy to remember but long enough to be 
    difficult to guess. It was created using just HTML, CSS, and javascript.
    The number substitution setting replaces some of the letters with numbers, 
    for example 8 replaces the letter b, and 3 replaces e.
    I've added an advanced setting which creates semi sentences. Each set of
    words is organized into a category: animals, verbs, names, and conjuctions. 
    Each sentence is then formed using the order name, verb, conjuct, animal.</p>

    <h2 id="api_mashup">API Mashup</h2>
    <a href="https://rtjohns-mn.github.io/midterm4131.io/" target="_blank">API Mashup - Youtube x Flickr</a>
    <p>This web application works as a search engine which uses the input 
    to search both youtube and flickr websites and returns the relevant 
    results. (NOTE: the number of videos searched per day is limited)</p>
    <p>I worked on the youtube side while my partner worked on the flickr side.
    To load youtube videos we must get a player to handle them. This is provided
    by the youtube.com/iframe_api as the object 'player'. To search youtube
    for specific videos is more difficult, we need to first get authorization 
    from youtube to make a request and then send a query to get responses back
    from the site. Then we need to get the information for the specific video, here it's
    the videoId, and then send that to the video player. This should change the player 
    to play the new video, if one exists.</p>

    <h2 id="eternal_jukebox">Eternal Jukebox Analysis</h2>
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g8-gZX74CK6QTlqiY0jJHcOna1hzXRzs/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Eternal Jukebox Analysis</a>
    <p>The Eternal Jukebox was created by Paul Lamere. The site allows 
    users to search for a song using the Spotify web API, which also separates 
    the song into segments and compares the similarity of each segment. Eternal Jukebox 
    then reassembles the segments back into the song, but with connections 
    between each matching segment. While playing the song when it hits a segment 
    with a connecting segment there is a chance that it will follow the connection 
    and continue at the new location. This allows the song to effectively remix 
    itself dynamically to create an infinite length track.</p>
    <p>We analyzed the program to find the best single loop location in all 
    songs. Eternal Jukebox compares the various parts of the track to find 
    the compatable loop sections. We adjusted the threshold for the loops to 
    only allow loops at the end and beginning and then only high quality ones.</p>

    <h2 id="flashphoto">Flashphoto Imaging Application</h2>
    <p>This program is a Photoshop style art program. My task was to create 
    the filters for the program and then to give the program a terminal 
    control to automate some of the features.</p>
